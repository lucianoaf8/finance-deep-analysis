### 1. Project Planning and Objective Setting

**Objective:**
Develop an AI model to analyze financial data from multiple bank accounts and provide detailed insights into account balances, income, expenses, liabilities, spending patterns, and interest/fees.

**Goals:**

- Aggregate data from multiple sources.
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Develop models to analyze different aspects of financial data.
- Generate reports and visualizations for financial insights.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

### 2. Data Collection and Integration

**Data Sources:**

- **Plaid Database:** Contains data from bank accounts like Tangerine, CIBC, Canadian Tire Bank.
- **Finance Database:** Contains data from MBNA credit card accounts.

**Steps:**

- Extract data from both the Plaid and Finance databases.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency.
- Integrate data from multiple sources into a unified dataset for analysis.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

**Steps:**

- Normalize data to ensure uniform scale across different features.
- Encode categorical variables such as transaction categories.
- Create new features, such as monthly aggregates, trends, and ratios (e.g., income-to-expense ratio).

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Steps:**

- Conduct descriptive analysis to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
- Visualize data to identify trends, outliers, and correlations.
- Summarize key statistics and insights from the data.

### 5. Feature Engineering

**Steps:**

- Identify relevant features for each analysis component (e.g., account balances, spending patterns).
- Generate features such as moving averages, percentage changes, and cumulative sums.
- Create time-based features to capture seasonality and trends.

### 6. Model Development

**Models to Develop:**

- **Account Balance Analysis:**
    - Develop time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast future account balances.
    - Analyze trends and seasonal patterns in account balances.
- **Income and Expense Analysis:**
    - Use classification models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to categorize transactions.
    - Develop regression models to predict future income and expenses.
- **Liabilities and Payments Analysis:**
    - Build models to assess credit card usage, minimum payments, and overdue status.
    - Predict future liabilities and suggest optimal payment strategies.
- **Spending Patterns Analysis:**
    - Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify spending patterns and major categories.
    - Analyze spending behavior and detect anomalies or irregularities.
- **Interest and Fees Analysis:**
    - Calculate effective interest rates and total fees incurred.
    - Develop models to predict future interest and fee charges based on historical data.

### 7. Model Evaluation and Validation

**Steps:**

- Split the data into training and test sets.
- Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression, accuracy for classification).
- Fine-tune models based on performance metrics.

### 8. Report Generation and Visualization

**Steps:**

- Develop a reporting system to generate detailed financial reports.
- Use visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create interactive dashboards.
- Summarize key insights, trends, and recommendations in an easy-to-understand format.

### 9. Deployment and Automation

**Steps:**

- Deploy the AI models as APIs or web services for real-time analysis.
- Set up automated data extraction, cleaning, and integration pipelines.
- Schedule regular updates and retraining of models to incorporate new data.

### 10. User Interface and Interaction

**Steps:**

- Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., web app, mobile app) for users to interact with the system.
- Provide options for users to input additional data or modify existing data.
- Enable users to generate custom reports and visualizations based on their preferences.

### 11. Monitoring and Maintenance

**Steps:**

- Continuously monitor model performance and data quality.
- Update models and retrain as necessary to maintain accuracy and relevance.
- Incorporate user feedback to improve the system and add new features.
