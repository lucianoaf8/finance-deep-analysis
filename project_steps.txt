Step 1: Project Planning and Objective Setting
Objective and Goals Documentation: Document the project's objectives and goals.
File: README.md (already exists)
Content: Include the objectives and goals as described in the prompt.
Step 2: Data Collection and Integration
Scripts Needed:

Data Extraction: Modify extract_data.py if necessary.
Data Cleaning: Modify clean_data.py if necessary.
Data Integration: Modify combine_data.py if necessary.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Scripts Needed:

Data Normalization and Encoding: Create a new script for preprocessing.
Feature Engineering: Create another script for creating new features.

Scripts and Their Roles
1. Data Extraction (extract_data.py)
Purpose: Extract data from Plaid and Finance databases.
Current Status: Exists but may need updates for robustness.
2. Data Cleaning (clean_data.py)
Purpose: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency.
Current Status: Exists but may need updates.
3. Data Integration (combine_data.py)
Purpose: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
Current Status: Exists but may need updates.
4. Data Normalization and Encoding (normalize_encode.py)
Purpose: Normalize data and encode categorical variables.
New Script: To be created.
5. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py)
Purpose: Create new features such as monthly aggregates, trends, and ratios.
New Script: To be created.
Next Steps
Verify and Update Existing Scripts: Ensure extract_data.py, clean_data.py, and combine_data.py meet the project's requirements.
Create New Scripts: Implement normalize_encode.py and feature_engineering.py.
Detailed Explanation of the Scripts
1. Data Extraction (extract_data.py)

Connects to the Plaid and Finance databases.
Extracts data into pandas DataFrames.
Logs the process and handles any exceptions.
2. Data Cleaning (clean_data.py)

Takes extracted DataFrames as input.
Removes duplicates and handles missing values (e.g., forward fill).
Logs the process and handles any exceptions.
3. Data Integration (combine_data.py)

Takes cleaned DataFrames as input.
Combines them into a single DataFrame.
Saves the combined DataFrame to a file for future use.
Logs the process and handles any exceptions.
4. Data Normalization and Encoding (normalize_encode.py)

Loads the combined DataFrame.
Normalizes numerical features to a standard scale.
Encodes categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Logs the process and handles any exceptions.
5. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py)

Loads the normalized and encoded DataFrame.
Creates new features such as monthly aggregates, trends, and income-to-expense ratios.
Logs the process and handles any exceptions.
Implementing the Plan
Let's start by reviewing and updating the existing scripts (extract_data.py, clean_data.py, and combine_data.py). Then, we'll proceed to create the new scripts (normalize_encode.py and feature_engineering.py).

1. Data Extraction (extract_data.py):

Ensure it connects to both Plaid and Finance databases.
Check if all required tables and columns are being extracted.
2. Data Cleaning (clean_data.py):

Verify the cleaning logic (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
Ensure it logs detailed messages for each step.
3. Data Integration (combine_data.py):

Check the logic for combining data from multiple sources.
Ensure it saves the combined DataFrame for future use.
4. Data Normalization and Encoding (normalize_encode.py):

Implement normalization of numerical features.
Implement encoding of categorical variables.
5. Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py):

Create new features relevant to financial analysis.
Ensure the script logs detailed messages for each step.
Final Verification
Once all scripts are implemented, run a full pipeline test to ensure each step works correctly.
Validate the final dataset to ensure it is ready for model development and analysis.
